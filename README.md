# PokerGuard: AI-Powered Collusion Detection

## Summary  
This project aims to build an AI system that profiles player behavior in online poker games to identify potential patterns of collusion or unfair play. By analyzing betting patterns, timing, and game decisions from large-scale online poker datasets, the AI will detect anomalies and flag suspicious behavior for further investigation.

## Background  
Online poker is a popular card game with millions of players worldwide. Unlike live poker, online poker is more vulnerable to collusion and unfair play because players cannot see each otherâ€™s physical tells, and communication between players can occur unnoticed.

While many anti-cheating measures exist, automated detection of subtle behavioral patterns indicative of collusion is still an open challenge. This project leverages AI to automatically analyze historical online poker hand histories to identify unusual cooperative behaviors or suspicious betting patterns.

## How is it used?  
Initially, the system is trained on hand histories from known fair games and documented collusion cases to learn typical and atypical player behavior. Once trained, the AI can analyze new game logs in real-time or in batch mode to detect suspicious player groups and flag hands or players exhibiting collusive traits.

The flagged cases can be reviewed by human experts to decide on further action, such as investigation or banning. The AI thus acts as a fast, scalable first-line defense to improve fairness in online poker platforms.

## Data Sources and AI Methods  
- Data will be gathered from public poker hand databases and online poker platforms that provide hand histories (including player actions, bet sizes, timings, outcomes).  
- Techniques: Sequence modeling (LSTM/Transformer) to model player actions over time, anomaly detection algorithms (autoencoders, isolation forest), graph-based analysis to detect suspicious player interaction networks.

## Challenges  
- Lack of labeled data for collusion cases may require semi-supervised or unsupervised learning approaches.  
- Player strategies vary widely, so distinguishing collusion from advanced legitimate strategies can be difficult.  
- Real-time detection demands efficient models that scale to large datasets.

## What next?  
If successful, the system could be integrated into online poker platforms to provide continuous monitoring and improve player trust. The approach may also extend to other online competitive games vulnerable to collusion or unfair collaboration.
